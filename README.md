## 1. User Stories (Required and Optional)

**Required Must-have Stories**

 * News feed where users can see friends post (Home page). Add friend button
 * Map where users can see the places they've traveled (Swipe L or R from home page)
 * A profile page with user stats, export feature
 * A friend list, settings page etc.
 * Posting feature where users can add pictures/places they've been and share in news feed
 * Explore button on map which takes the users live location into account and lists fun things/activities to do in the area (another activity) - Or just an adventure of the day

**Optional Nice-to-have Stories**
 * From the list of activities to do in the area - users can sort them based on price, date, cateogory (business, etc). One idea is to use the event brite api which sorts this for you already https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api
 * From the map, users have the option to toggle their visibility to other users (friends) and can see other users on the map as well by toggling button
 * Users have the option to click the camera button on the toolbar and can learn more information about buildings/art with their camera
 * Travel badges .. more cities = more badges. Or more unique places = cool badges.
